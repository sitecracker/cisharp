Project Structure:
Create a Solution:
Create a new .NET solution named &quot;WebApiSolution.&quot;
Class Libraries:
Create the following class libraries within the solution:
Domain: Define two model classes (Customer and Order).
Data: Implement a DbContext class (AppDbContext) and manage database migrations.
Services: Create a service class (OrderService) responsible for business logic related to
products.
Web API Project:
Create a Web API project named &quot;WebApiApp.&quot;
Set up appsettings.json with a connection string for the database.
Controller:
Implement a controller (OrdersController) in the Web API project.
Use dependency injection to inject the OrderService into the controller.
Create API endpoints for:
Retrieving all orders.
Retrieving a single order by ID.
Adding a new order.
Updating an existing order.
Deleting an order.
Retrieving all orders for a specific customer.
Retrieving the total price of orders for a specific customer.
Retrieving the total price of orders per customer.
Database Integration:
Configure Entity Framework Core in the Web API project to use the AppDbContext.
Models:
Implement the Customer and Order models in the Domain class library.
Customer Domain Class (Domain):
Id:
Type: Integer
Description: Unique identifier for the customer.
Name:
Type: String

Description: Name of the customer.
Email:
Type: String
Description: Email address of the customer.
Additional Properties (Optional):
Address, PhoneNumber, or any other properties relevant to your application.
Order Domain Class:
Id:
Type: Integer
Description: Unique identifier for the order.
Product:
Type: String
Description: Name of the product in the order.
Price:
Type: Decimal
Description: Price of the product in the order.
CustomerId:
Type: Integer
Description: Identifier indicating the customer who placed the order.
Additional Properties (Optional):
OrderDate, Quantity, or any other properties relevant to your application.
DbContext:
Create the AppDbContext class in the Data class library, inheriting from DbContext.
Include DbSet properties for both Customer and Order.
Services:
Implement the OrderService class in the Services class library.
Include methods for CRUD operations on products.
Controller Actions:
Implement actions in the OrdersController to interact with the OrderService.
Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each action.
Dependency Injection:
Inject the OrderService into the OrdersController using constructor injection.

Testing:
Use a tool like Postman or Swagger to test the API endpoints.
Test each endpoint for various scenarios, especially those involving the enhanced service logic.
Note:
For the endpoints that accept parameters (e.g., customer ID), ensure proper validation and error
handling.
Implement error responses with meaningful messages and appropriate
